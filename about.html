            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a student with a passion for web development and design. I’m currently exploring the world of coding and creating websites, and I enjoy working with various tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress to bring ideas to life. Even though I’m still in the learning process, I’m constantly improving my skills and eager to dive deeper into web development.</p>
            <p>In addition to web development, I have a strong interest in graphic design. I love working on creative projects and bringing an artistic touch to digital designs. I’m also experienced in social media management and content creation, where I’ve learned to communicate effectively and engage audiences through visuals and creative content.</p>
            <p>I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow, whether it's through online courses, collaborations, or personal projects. I’m excited about the journey ahead and the many ways I can continue learning and applying my skills in the digital world.</p>
